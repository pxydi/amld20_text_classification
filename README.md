# AMLD20 - Spam Detection

Welcome! This repository contains all resources for the **Spam Detection** hands-on exercise, presented during the [EPFL Extension School Workshop - Machine Learning and Data Visualization](https://appliedmldays.org/workshops/epfl-extension-school-workshop-machine-learning-and-data-visualization) at the [Applied Machine Learning Days 2020](https://appliedmldays.org/).

In this hands-on exercise, participant are tasked to preprocess examples of spam and ham emails, and train their own text classifier. The goal of this hands-on exercise is to provide a general overview on the topic of text classification. At the end of this workshop, the participants will be able to train their own text classifier, trained on spam/ham emails, and to predict the most likely class membership of any new sample of text.

## Run Hands-On locally on your machine

Should you prefer to run the hands-on locally on your machine, either install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your system and use the provided [environment.yml](https://github.com/epfl-exts/amld20-image-classification/blob/master/environment.yml) file, or use your python environment of chose and use the [colab-requirements.txt](https://github.com/epfl-exts/amld20-image-classification/blob/master/colab-requirements.txt) file to install the required Python dependencies with `pip`.
